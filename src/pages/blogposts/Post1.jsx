              <h2>Create a simpler design</h2>
              <p>
                A clean and simple design makes your website easier to use and
                remember. Users shouldn't have to hunt through clutter to find
                what they need. Focus on clear navigation, readable fonts, and a
                well-organized layout. Stick to just a few colours and keep the
                information short and to the point. Remember, less is more your
                goal is to guide users effortlessly to the info or actions
                they're looking for.

              <h2>Improve mobile responsiveness</h2>
              <p>
                With so many people browsing on their phones, your website needs
                to look and work great on all screen sizes. Use a responsive
                design that adjusts automatically to fit mobile, tablet, and
                desktop screens. Buttons should be easy to tap, text should be
                readable without zooming, and images should resize without
                cutting off important details. A{" "}

              <h2>Make your website load faster</h2>
              <p>
                Nobody likes waiting for a slow website. In fact, a few seconds
                can make visitors leave. Compress images, minimize code, and use
                caching to speed things up. If you're using videos, make sure
                they're optimized for web use. A faster website not only

              <h2>Lastly, test and iterate continuously</h2>
              <p>
                The best websites are always improving. Regularly test your site
                by clicking around like a visitor would. Are the links working?
                Are the forms easy to fill out? Ask for feedback from real users
                and keep tweaking based on what you learn.
