            Hi, I'm Lusapho Matiti, but you can call me 'Ludz'. I'm a Full-Stack
            Developer who loves building websites and web applications. I work
            with ReactJS to make web pages and web apps look good and work well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I focus on making sure everything looks just right on the screen and
            works smoothly. I enjoy making web applications that are easy to use
            and leave a good impression.
          </p>

              <p>
                But it's not all about the code â€“ when I'm not immersed in the
                world of web development, you can find me exploring the great
                outdoors, working-out, playing football with friends, or
                listening to my favorite songs. Life's too short to stick to
                just one passion, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                So, welcome to my corner of the web. Whether you want to work on
                a project together or just chat about web development, I'm happy
                you're here. Let's create something awesome together!
              </p>
